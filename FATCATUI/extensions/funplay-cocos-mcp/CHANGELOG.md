## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added Node.js unit tests for MCP protocol negotiation, tool profile exports, tool execution errors, and project file path safety.

### Changed

- Updated the MCP initialize response to negotiate protocol version `2025-11-25` by default while retaining compatibility with older supported protocol versions.
- Added `structuredContent` to tool call results when a tool returns structured JSON data.
- Changed tool execution failures to return MCP tool errors instead of JSON-RPC internal errors, improving client-side self-correction.
- Updated CI to run the new Node.js test suite.

### Security

- Restricted project file and asset-path resources to paths inside the active Cocos project root.
- Added HTTP request body size limits and invalid `Origin` header rejection for the embedded MCP server.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added automatic port fallback when the configured MCP port is already occupied.
- Added actual-running-port reporting in MCP server status and panel state.
- Added `.github/pull_request_template.md` for repository contribution guidance.
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for lightweight GitHub validation.
- Added a lightweight GitHub Star promotion log after successful MCP server startup.

### Changed

- Updated one-click MCP client configuration to write the actual running server port instead of the requested port when port fallback is active.
- Updated the MCP panel status line to show configured-port to actual-port fallback information.
- Updated the English and Chinese README files to document automatic port fallback behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed VS Code one-click configuration to use platform-specific config paths with macOS fallback behavior.
- Fixed Windows one-click MCP configuration path resolution by using a more reliable home/appdata lookup strategy.
